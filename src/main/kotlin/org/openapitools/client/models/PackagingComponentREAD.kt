/**
 * Each packaging component has different properties to specify how many there are, its shape, material etc.  The shape, material and recycling properties are mapped to one entry in the packaging_shapes, packaging_materials and packaging_recycling taxonomies, and the value of the property is the canonical name of the taxonomy entry (e.g. en:bottle).  They may contain values that could not yet get matched to their respective taxonomy, in which case they will contain a free text value prefixed with the language code of this text value (e.g. \"fr:Bouteille sph√©rique\" might have been entered by a French user to indicate it is a spherical bottle).
 *
 * @param numberOfUnits umber of units of this packaging component contained in the product (e.g. 6 for a pack of 6 bottles)
 * @param shape 
 * @param material 
 * @param recycling 
 * @param quantityPerUnit Quantity (weight or volume) of food product contained in the packaging component. (e.g. 75cl for a wine bottle)
 * @param quantityPerUnitValue Value parsed from the quantity field.
 * @param quantityPerUnitUnit Unit parsed and normalized from the quantity field.
 * @param weightSpecified Weight (as specified by the manufacturer) of one unit of the empty packaging component (in grams). (e.g. for a 6 pack of 1.5l water bottles, it might be 30, the weight in grams of 1 empty water bottle without its cap which is a different packaging component).
 * @param weightMeasured Weight (as measured by one or more users) of one unit of the empty packaging component (in grams). (e.g. for a 6 pack of 1.5l water bottles, it might be 30, the weight in grams of 1 empty water bottle without its cap which is a different packaging component).
 * @param weightEstimated Weight (as estimated from similar products) of one unit of the empty packaging component (in grams). (e.g. for a 6 pack of 1.5l water bottles, it might be 30, the weight in grams of 1 empty water bottle without its cap which is a different packaging component).
 * @param weight Weight of one unit of the empty packaging component.
 * @param weightSourceId Indicates which field was used to populate the \"weight\" field. Either \"specified\", \"measured\", or \"estimated\"
